# LL-first-follow
First and follow functions are used to aid the LL algorithm in parsing.


# How to use 

1. Compute First as follows
```
from  first import getFirst
firstMap = getFirst(input)
```

2. Compute Follow as follows

```
from  follow import  getFollow
       
followMap = getFollow(input)

```
